# ARCOR2 SAR

This repository contains user interface, based on projected augmented reality, which complements [AREditor](https://github.com/robofit/arcor2_areditor), the main user interface of the [ARCOR2](https://github.com/robofit/arcor2) system.

## Usage

### Calibration

First of all, you need to calibrate the system. To help you with that, you can use this [guide](https://github.com/xstrof00/arcor2_sar/blob/main/Calibration/README.md).

### Building in Unity

After calibration, it is necessary to build the project in Unity, so that the project can use the calibration results from previous step when creating the scene.

### Run the application

Last step is to run the built application. It should connect to the ARServer automatically.
